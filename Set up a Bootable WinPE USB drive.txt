Set up a Bootable WinPE USB drive:

⦁ Use a drive that’s at least 16GB.

⦁ UEFI requires FAT32 for booting, but you can keep the rest of the USB as NTFS.

⦁ Make a Two-Partition USB (UEFI + Large NTFS).
  diskpart
  list disk
  select disk X
  clean

⦁ Create the FAT32 boot partition:
  create partition primary size=2000
  format fs=fat32 quick label="BOOT"
  assign letter=E
⦁ Create the large NTFS partition:
  create partition primary
  format fs=ntfs quick label="IMAGES"
  assign letter=F
  exit

⦁ On the Technician PC, open the “Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment” as Administrator, this is under “Windows Kits” in the Start Menu. 
  Copy the WinPE files to a working folder (the folder will be created automatically):
  copype amd64 C:\WinPE

⦁ Copy the WinPE files to your USB key.
  makewinpemedia /ufd C:\WinPE E:

  Where E: is the FAT32 partition of the USB drive. 
  This will format the USB drive and erase any data that’s on it.
